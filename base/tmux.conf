# This configuration file binds many vi- and vim-like bindings to the
# appropriate tmux key bindings.  Note that for many key bindings there is no
# tmux analogue.  This is intended for tmux 1.3, which handles pane selection
# differently from the previous versions

# split windows like vim
# vim's definition of a horizontal/vertical split is reversed from tmux's
#bind s split-window -v
#bind v split-window -h

# resize panes like vim
# feel free to change the "1" to however many lines you want to resize by, only
# one at a time can be slow
bind < resize-pane -L 1
bind > resize-pane -R 1
bind - resize-pane -D 1
bind + resize-pane -U 1

bind / neww 'exec htop'
bind m neww 'exec cmus'

# bind : to command-prompt like vim
# this is the default in tmux already
bind : command-prompt
# vi-style controls for copy mode
set -g status-keys vi
setw -g mode-keys vi

set -g prefix C-a
unbind C-b
bind C-a send-prefix

# set -g status off
set -g status-bg black
set -g status-fg white
set -g status-left "#[fg=yellow]#T"
# Highlight active window
